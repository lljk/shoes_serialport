CHANGES SINCE RELEASE 3:

  * Rational versioning scheme: (major.minor.build) Small changes
    increment the build number. Significant changes that don't affect
    backwards compatibility increment the minor number. Major changes
    that will break backwards compatibility will increment the major
    number.

  * Optimizations: Speed increases of 5-10% should be common.

  * Groove Joint: Similar to a pivot joint, but one of the anchors is
    on a linear slide instead of being fixed.

  * Comments/cleanup. The code should be much more readable now.

  * Official build paths for working on Linux and MSVC.
